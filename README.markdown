THIS PLUGIN IS UNDER EXTREMELY EARLY DEVELOPMENT, NOT SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE

The intention of this plugin is to introduce a more process driven workflow to 
Redmine.  It replaces manually selecting a new status with a simple checklist.
The workflow is then driven by the responses to the questions.
